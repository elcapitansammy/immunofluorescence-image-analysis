This is a basic analysis tool for analyzing immunofluorescent images of cells. The most important files are the restarting.py file and the speckles_count.py 

restarting.py: 
- function to create masks (cells) based on the Blue color (DAPI) of a immunofluorescent image.
- function to calculate the average intensity of color in each mask (cell).

speckles_count.py:
- function to create masks (cells) based on the Blue color (DAPI) of a immunofluorescent image.
- function to create graphs to analyze the intensity of the green color in each cell. 

Note: this code has been developed in collaboration with github copilot
